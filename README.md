# Basic Image Processing
This is the project using OpenCV to get image data, all the configuration will be done by using equation and kernel and more. \
Also, by usinng this project, you will evaluate how the system work sequentially vs parallel. \
This was conducted by our team and this is also the project for the Parallel Programming Course of Hanoi University of Science and Technology
# What type of configuration
In this project, there are five types of configuration:
- Blur: Bluring an image
- Sharpness: Shapenning an image
- RGBtoYCrCb: Converting an image to YCrCb
- Brightness: Brighten or darken an image
- Saturation: Saturating an image
# Wait, why comparing sequentially vs parallel
Yes, this is for evaluating time using parallel code besides using sequential code. At first, this project using OpenMP to parallel, so in the future we will use CUDA and OpenCL to parallel on GPU. It will be faster and more effeciently while processing an image
# Some result
This is some result of benchmarking an image which size is 4.56MB

# Will update soon
At this time right now, our team is working hard on the next evaluation, stay tuned for more !
